# Carlos

V2.0.0 :
The configuration is now in the config.ini file
Run start.py to start the bot

Carlos is a moderation IRC Bot. He can send public/private messages, actions and notices. The strings are french, it's up to you to translate.

- Each command is sent to the bot by IRC private messages
- Each command must end with the password (editable in config.ini)
- To get the command list, enter !help (with the password, of course)
- Don't forget to set the channel operator mode to the bot (in order to be able to change topic, set user modes etc)

Enjoy ! :D
