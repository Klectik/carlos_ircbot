# carlos_ircbot
Carlos is a moderation IRC Bot. He can send public/private messages, actions and notices. The strings are french, it's up to you to translate.

- Each command is sent to the bot by IRC private messages
- Each command must end with the password (21st line of carlos.py)
- To get the commands list, enter !help (with the password, of sure)
- Don't forget to set the bot operator (to be able to change topic, set user modes etc)

Enjoy ! :D
